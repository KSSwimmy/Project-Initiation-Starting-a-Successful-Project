### Key components of project initiation video notes

There are several key components of initiation that you need to consider in order for your project to be successful: 

**goals** -  the goal is what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve. All projects should have clear goals and often those will be determined by senior company leaders, with your help.

**scope** -  the process to define the work that needs to happen to complete the project.
You also need to think about project deliverables. They're the products and services that you will create for your customer, client or project sponsor.

**deliverables** -  They're the products and services that you will create for your customer, client or project sponsor. Deliverables can be anything from product features and functionalities to documentation, processes and more, anything that enables the goal of your project to be achieved. Deliverables are submitted to help you reach your project goals.

**success criteria** - Success criteria are the standards by which you measure how successful a project was in reaching its goals.

**stakeholders** -  Stakeholders are key to making informed decisions at every step of the project, including the initiation phase.
They're the people who both have interest in and are affected by the completion and success of a project.

**resources** - resources generally refer to the budget, people, materials, and other items that you will have at your disposal. It's super important to think carefully about these pieces early on.


Finally, once you've established your goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders, and resources, it's time to create a project charter. A **project charter** is a document that contains all the details of the project. Project charters clearly define the project and its goals and outline what is needed to accomplish them. A project charter allows you to get organized, set up a framework for what needs to be done and communicate those details to others.

### Reflection: Project initiation and key components 

Question 1
In this exercise, you will read a scenario and identify the six key components of project initiation:

- Goals

- Scope

- Project deliverables

- Success criteria

- Stakeholders

- Resources

Start by reading the scenario:

Imagine you are a project manager at an educational software company. You’re assigned a new project to develop a digital grading platform for a local high school. Before beginning the project, you meet with teachers, school administrators, the school IT department, and the district superintendent to discuss the project and get their input. 

During these meetings, you organized your thoughts by writing down project key components that the stakeholders have requested. Your notes on the key components are:

- $150,000 maximum budget  

- Team: can add one member from the school IT department  

- Platform should allow teachers to enter grades and allow students/parents to view grades  

- Need full teacher buy-in at high school: 100% adoption within next nine months   

- Project should focus only on the digital grading platform and NOT impact other digital platforms (ex. attendance, school lunch payments)  

- Overall, the school is seeking a platform for digital grading 

The next step in the project is to organize the key components into a project charter. You will then present the charter to the individuals involved with the project. The project charter ensures everyone is aligned before planning and then executing the project.

***Which of the key components is the project’s goal? Write one sentence.***

**A:** The project’s goal is what you’ve been asked to do and what you’re trying to achieve. The goals are often determined by senior leaders at an organization or company. Did you consider the goal as: To launch a digital grading platform for the high school and get full teacher adoption? 

***Which key component outlines the project’s scope? Write one sentence.***

**A:** Project managers use scope as a boundary—what should or shouldn’t be included in the project. In the scenario above, the project scope is: Creating the digital grading platform and not updating other digital platforms the school uses such as attendance or meal payments. 

***Which key component is the project deliverable? Write one sentence.***

**A:** A deliverable is the tangible and intangible outcomes of a project. The deliverables in the examples are: A platform for teachers to enter grades and students to view their grades.

***Which key component outlines the project’s success criteria? Write one sentence.***

**A:** The success criteria are the standards by which you measure how successful a project is in reaching its goals. Did you consider: 100% of teachers adopt the digital grading platform within the next nine months? 

***Who are the project stakeholders? Write one sentence.***

**A:** Stakeholders are people who have an interest in, or are affected by, the completion of a successful project: teachers, students, parents, school administrators, school IT department, and the district superintendent. 

***Which key components outline the resources you will have at your disposal for the project?***

**A:** Resources generally refer to the budget, people, and materials available to complete the project. In the scenario, it’s the budget of $150,000 and the member from the school’s IT department.

### Performing a cost-benefit analysis

Previously, you learned that a cost-benefit analysis is the process of adding up the expected value of a project—the benefits—and comparing them to the dollar costs. In this reading, we will discuss the benefits of conducting a cost-benefit analysis, guiding questions to help you and your stakeholders conduct one, and how to calculate return on investment (ROI).

##### The benefits of a cost-benefit analysis

A cost-benefit analysis can minimize risks and maximize gains for projects and organizations. It can help you communicate clearly with stakeholders and executives and keep your project on track. Because this type of analysis uses objective data, it can help reduce biases and keep stakeholder self-interest from influencing decisions. 

Comparing a project’s benefits to its costs can help you make a strong business case to stakeholders and leadership and ensure your organization pursues the most profitable or useful projects. Organizations use cost-benefit analyses to reduce waste and invest their resources responsibly.

##### Guiding questions for a cost-benefit analysis

When you’re pursuing a project, the benefits should outweigh the costs. It’s important for you and your stakeholders to consider questions like the ones that follow early on, while you prepare the proposal.

To determine the benefits of a project, you might ask:

- ***What value will this project create?*** 

- ***How much money could this project save our organization?*** 

- ***How much money will it bring in from existing customers?***

- ***How much time will it save?*** 

- ***How will it improve the customer experience?***

And to determine the costs of a project, consider questions such as:

- ***How much time will people have to spend on this project?***

- ***What are the one-time costs?***

- ***Are there any ongoing costs?***

- ***What about long-term costs?*** 

You might also consider questions about intangible benefits. These are gains that are not quantifiable, such as:

- **Customer satisfaction**. Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services? 

- **Employee satisfaction.** Is the project likely to improve employee morale, reducing turnover? 

- **Employee productivity.** Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?

- **Brand perception.** Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?

You can also flip these questions to consider intangible costs. These are costs that are not quantifiable. For example, might the project put customer retention, employee satisfaction, or brand perception at risk?

When assigning values to tangible or intangible costs and benefits, you can reference similar past projects, conduct industry research, or consult with experts.

Calculating costs and benefits
The process of calculating costs and benefits is also called calculating **return on investment**, or **ROI**. There are many ways to determine a project’s ROI, but the easiest way is to compare the upfront and ongoing costs to its benefits over time.

One common ROI formula is:
### ` (G-C) / C = ROI`

In this formula, G represents the financial gains you expect from the project, and C represents the upfront and ongoing costs of your investment in the project.

For example, imagine your project costs $6,000 up front plus $25 per month for 12 months. This equals $300 per year, but you estimate that the project will bring in $10,000 in revenue over the course of that year. Using the formula above, you calculate the ROI as: ($10,000 - $6,300) ÷ $6,300 = 0.58 = 58%

The ROI comes to 0.58, or 58%. You consider this to be a strong ROI, so you decide to pursue the project.

# Week 2

### Determining project goals and deliverables

The **project goal** is the desired outcome of the project. It's what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve. 
For example: 
- Your goal could be to improve the response time to customer inquiries via email by 20 percent. The goal of your Office Green project might be to increase revenue by five percent through a new service called Plant Pals that offers desk plants to top customers by the end of the year. 

Well-defined goals are both specific and measurable. They give you a clear sense of what you are trying to accomplish. Really great goals have even more detail.

These goals also tell you how to do what you've been asked to do.

When you start a project, take time to review your goals and make sure they're well-defined. To do this, **you might need to get more information from your stakeholders.** Talk to them about their vision for the project. Ask how this aligns to the company's larger goals and mission. By the end of that conversation, you and your stakeholders should agree to support the project goals in order to avoid running into issues later on.

**Project deliverables** are the products or services that are created for the customer, client, or project sponsor. In other words, a deliverable is what gets produced or presented at the end of a task, event, or process.

Take the goal to improve customer response time. the deliverable for that goal could be the creation of email templates for responding to typical questions. Your Office Green project goal to increase revenues could have these two deliverables: 
- launching the plant service
- a finished website that highlights the new kinds of plants being offered. 

There are all sorts of project deliverable examples. A pretty common one is a report. When a goal is reached, you can visibly see the results documented in the chart, graph, or presentation. Deliverables help us quantify and realize the impact of the project.

### How to set SMART goals video notes

Be attainable, be relevant, and be time-bound. Put them all together, and what do you have? SMART goals. As an entry-level project manager, you may or may not be setting the project's main goals, but you will need to be able to identify and clarify them as needed, and that's where the SMART method can be a valuable tool.

**Specific** goals should answer at least two of the questions I'm about to ask. 
- What do I want to accomplish? 
- Why is this a goal? 
- Does it have a specific reason, purpose, or benefit? 
- Who is involved? 
- Who is the recipient? Employees, customers, the community at large? 
- Where should the goal be delivered? 

To what degree? In other words, what are the requirements and constraints? 

**Measuring** is not only a way for people to track progress, but also a tool to help people stay motivated. 

You can tell the goal is measurable by asking

- How much?
- How many?
- How will I know when it's accomplished? 

Sometimes the success of a goal can be measured with a simple yes or no. 

You will need to measure most of the goals you have with metrics. Metrics, what you use to measure something like numbers or figures. For example, if your goal was to run a five kilometer race, then distance in kilometers is your metric. 

consider benchmarks or points of reference to make sure you're choosing accurate metrics. For instance, if your overall goal is to increase revenue, you can look at last year's data as a benchmark for deciding how much to increase revenue this year. 

 Is it **attainable**? Can it reasonably be reached based on the metrics? Typically, you want goals that are a little challenging to encourage growth, otherwise, what's the point of the goal if nothing's going to change? However, you don't want it to be too extreme or you'll never reach it.

 A clue to helping you figure out if your goal is attainable, is to ask: 
 - How can it be accomplished? Break down the goal into smaller parts and see if it makes sense.

 Now let's see if it's **relevant.** 
 - Does it make sense to try and reach this goal? 
Think about how the goal lines up with other goals, priorities and values. Ask whether the goal seems worthwhile. Does the effort involved balance out the benefits? Does it match your organizations' other needs and priorities?
- Ask whether the goal seems worthwhile. 
- Does the effort involved balance out the benefits? 
- Does it match your organizations' other needs and priorities?
Everyone, from the client, the project team, and the people who will ultimately use the product, need to feel like the goal is worth supporting. Also, consider the timing.
- Is it the right time?

**Time-bound** means your goal has a deadline. Deadlines give you a way to track your progress, otherwise, you may never reach your goal or never even get started. Time and metrics often go hand in hand, because time can also be used as a metric. Making your goal time-bound gives you a way to break down how much needs to be accomplished over time.



***What can help create a measurable goal? Select all that apply.***


**A:** It’s important for project managers to set well-defined goals. That’s why SMART goals are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. Metrics, such as figures or numbers, make goals measurable. The accuracy of metrics are confirmed with points of reference, called **benchmarks**.

**A:** SMART goals are well-defined goals that help keep projects on track. They’re specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. SMART goals are measured with figures or numbers known as metrics. Benchmarks are used to help confirm the accuracy of **metrics**.

### Reading SMART goals: Making goals meaningful

In this lesson you are learning to define and create measurable project goals and deliverables. Now, let's focus on SMART goals.

**Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant,** and **Time-bound (SMART)** goals are very helpful for ensuring project success. As you start your career in project management, you may not directly set the project goals, but you should be able to clarify and understand them. SMART goals help you see the full scope of a goal, determine its feasibility, and clearly define project success in concrete terms. 

Let’s recap what we discussed in the previous video by taking a look at a breakdown of the criteria for SMART goals below: 

- **Specific:** The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret. 

- **Measurable:** Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.

- **Attainable:** The project team agrees the objective is realistic.

- **Relevant:** The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.

- **Time-bound:** The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.

You may see variations on what each letter in the “SMART” acronym stands for. (For example, you may see “actionable” or “achievable” instead of “attainable” or “realistic” instead of “relevant.”) However, the general intent of each of these terms—to make sure the goal is within reach—is always similar.

##### Focusing on the "M" in SMART

Let’s take a moment to zoom in on the **M** in SMART, which stands for measurable. Having **measurable** goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics, such as dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc. Measurable goals are important because they leave little room for confusion around expectations from stakeholders. 

Not every metric will have value, so you will have to determine which metrics make sense for the project. For example, measuring how many meetings the software engineers on your project attend on a weekly basis may not be the most valuable metric for a productivity goal. Alternatively, you might measure other aspects of the engineers’ productivity, such as a particular number of features created per engineer or a specific number of issues flagged per day.

##### Defining a SMART goal

Let’s explore an example related to making a personal goal measurable. Imagine you are looking to make a career change, and you set a goal to complete a Google Career Certificate. You can **measure** the success of this goal because after completing the entire program, you will receive a certificate—a tangible outcome.

Now, let’s determine how to make the remaining elements of this goal SMART. In this example, your **specific** goal is to attain a Google Career Certificate. You can make this goal attainable by deciding that you will complete one course per month. This goal is **relevant** because it supports your desire to make a career change. Finally, you can make this goal **time-bound** by deciding that you will complete the program within six months.

After defining each of these components, your SMART goal then becomes: Obtain a Google Career Certificate by taking one course per month within the next six months.

### Activity: Define and determine SMART project goals

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

Office Green, LLC, is a commercial landscaping company that specializes in plant decor for offices and other businesses. The company is getting ready to introduce its new Plant Pals service, which will provide high-volume customers with small, low-maintenance plants for their desks. You are the project manager assigned to manage the Plant Pals launch.

Office Green’s main goal for this project is: “Increase revenue by 5% by the end of the year by rolling out a new service that provides office plants to high-volume clients.”

You recently met with the project sponsor (the Director of Product) to discuss two additional goals for the Plant Pals project:

1. Boost Office Green’s brand awareness

2. Raise Office Green’s customer retention rate

In order to help your team achieve these two additional project goals, you need to turn them into SMART goals. The notes from your meeting with the Director of Product are below. You can use this information to create SMART goals:

- Office Green’s customer retention rate was 80% last year, but the CEO wants that number to increase by at least 10% this year.

- Last year, 70% of customers who left Office Green for competitors said they did so because they wanted more extensive services. When surveyed, 85% of existing customers expressed an interest in Plant Pals.

- The Vice President of Customer Success expects Office Green to achieve a customer satisfaction rating of over 90% this year—a slight increase over last year. The rating has stayed between 85%-90% for the last five years.

- The company plans to create an Operations and Training plan for Plant Pals to improve on existing customer service standards and boost efficiency.

- Office Green will promote the new service with a new marketing and sales strategy, a redesigned website with a new Plant Pals landing page, and a print catalog. 

- With the publicity around the launch, Office Green projects that their customer base will grow by at least 15%.

- Website traffic has dipped slightly over the past three years, from 15K to 13K visits each month. The Marketing Manager wants unique page visits to increase by at least 2K each month by the end of the year, which is in line with the results of prior marketing campaigns.

- The project is scheduled to launch by the end of the third quarter. The project team will continue to collect data on the project’s progress through the rest of the year and assess how well it has met its goals at the end of the fourth quarter. (It is currently the start of Q1.)

**Step 2: Revise the goals to be SMART**

The template contains the two additional project goals for Plant Pals, neither of which meets all the SMART criteria:

1. “Office Green will boost brand awareness”

2. “Office Green will raise their customer retention rate”

Turn these two goals into SMART goals using the information from the scenario above. Write the revised goals next to **SMART Goal One** and **SMART Goal Two**. Your goals should be complete, but brief—one or two sentences is enough.

For example, here is a goal that’s missing some of the SMART criteria:

*“Office Green will soon create an app to help customers care for their plants.”*

That’s not a bad start, but it isn’t specific, measurable, or time-bound. Here’s the same goal, rewritten as a SMART goal:

*“Office Green will create an app that offers tips and reminders to help customers care for their plants. The app will be completed within 18 months and be compatible with 100% of the types of plants Office Green sells.”*

**Step 3: Explain what makes each goal SMART**

Now that you’ve rewritten the goals, explain what makes them SMART by answering the following questions:

1. What makes the goal **specific**? Does it provide enough detail to avoid ambiguity?

2. What makes the goal **measurable**? Does it include metrics to gauge success?

3. What makes the goal **attainable**? Is it realistic given available time and resources?

4. What makes the goal **relevant**? Does it support project or business objectives?

5. What makes the goal **time-bound**? Does it include a timeline or deadline?

Be specific in your answers. For instance, the plant care app SMART goal is:

- **Specific:** The team knows what they’re building: an app that helps users care for their plants and reminds them to do so. 

- **Measurable:** The app will be complete when it includes 100% of the plant types Office Green sells.

- **Attainable:** The company has the knowledge, time, resources to build the app. 

- **Relevant:** Office Green’s business model relies on customers caring for their plants successfully. 

- **Time-bound:** The goal includes an 18-month timeframe.

If you find that either goal does not meet all the SMART criteria, try revising it and answering the questions again.

### Activity Exemplar: Define and determine SMART project goals

**SMART goal one**

The original goal indicates that Office Green will boost its overall brand awareness through Plant Pals, but it doesn’t indicate how they will do it, whether it's possible, why it’s important, or when they will get it done. The SMART goal addresses all these questions, which increases Office Green’s chances of reaching their aim:

“Office Green will boost brand awareness with a new marketing and sales strategy and website update that will increase page views by 2K per month by the end of the year.”

- **Specific:** Office Green will update their website and launch a new marketing and sales strategy to boost awareness of their brand.

- **Measurable:** The goal includes a metric of 2K new page views per month.

- **Attainable:** They have a year to reach this goal and the target of 2K new page views per month is in line with prior marketing campaigns.

- **Relevant:** Greater brand awareness can mean new customers, which supports the overall project goal of a 5% revenue increase.

- **Time-bound:** The deadline is at the end of the year.

**SMART goal two**

The original goal indicates that Office Green will raise their customer retention rate, but it doesn’t indicate how they will do it, whether it's possible, why it’s important, or when they will get it done. The SMART goal addresses all these questions, which increases Office Green’s chances of reaching their aim:

“Office Green will raise their overall customer retention rate by 10% by the end of the year by implementing a new Operations & Training plan for the Plant Pals service.”

- **Specific:** Office Green will implement an Operations & Training plan that will improve on existing customer service standards and boost efficiency. 

- **Measurable:** The goal includes a metric of a 10% increase in retention. 

- **Attainable:** They have a year to reach this goal and many former and existing customers are interested in the new service. It has the potential to help them keep customers who may be thinking about leaving for a landscaper with more services.

- **Relevant:** Increasing customer retention can lead to more sales, which supports the overall project goal of a 5% revenue increase.

- **Time-bound:** The deadline is at the end of the year.

### Introduction to OKRS video notes

objectives and Key results, or OKRS.

Like the SMART method, OKRS help establish and clarify goals or objectives for an organization, department, project or person.

 OKRS take SMART goals a step further by combining a goal and more detailed metrics to determine a measurable outcome.

 **The O stands for objective**, and defines what needs to be achieved. It describes the desired result or outcome, such as an increase in customer retention, or an improvement on the employee onboarding process.

**KR stands for key results.** These are the measurable outcomes that define when the objective has been met. For example, if your objective is to improve customer retention, then the key result might be to have 90 percent customer satisfaction rating by the end of the first quarter.

use OKRS to set stretch goals as a way to challenge ourselves to do something we haven't accomplished before.

In order to focus their efforts to reach this objective, Office Green might develop key results that include 
95 percent of phone, chat, and email customer support tickets are resolved during the first contact.
Top three most requested new offerings for distributed office environments are in pilot by the end of the second quarter
sales and support channels are available 24/7 by the end of the year. 

Some of these company-level key results could become the basis for projects.

- OKR stands for Objective and Key Results. They combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. 
- Objectives define what needs to be achieved and describe a desired outcome. 
- Key Results define how you will measure the outcome of your objective. 
- Company-level OKRs are shared across an organization so that everyone can align and focus their efforts to help the company reach its goals.
- Project-level OKRs help define measurable project goals. They need to align with and support both company and departmental-level OKRs.

### Reading: Creating OKRs for your project

**In this lesson, you are learning to define and create measurable project goals and deliverables. This reading will focus on creating effective objectives and key results (OKRs) and how to implement them into your project.**


Company-wide OKRs are used to set an ultimate goal for an entire organization, while team, department, and project-level OKRs describe the focused results each group will need to achieve in order to support the organization.

##### OKRs and project management

As a project manager, OKRs can help you expand upon project goals and further clarify the deliverables you’ll need from the project to accomplish those goals. Project-level OKRs help establish the appropriate scope for your team so that you can say “no” to requests that may get in the way of them meeting their objectives. You can also create and use project-level OKRs to help motivate your team since OKRs are intended to challenge you to push past what’s easily achievable. 

#### Creating OKRs for your project

##### Set your objectives

Project objectives should be aspirational, aligned with organizational goals, action-oriented, concrete, and significant. Consider the vision you and your stakeholders have for your project and determine what you want the project team to accomplish in 3–6 months.

Examples:

- Build the most secure data security software 

- Continuously improve web analytics and conversions

- Provide a top-performing service

- Make a universally-available app

- Increase market reach

- Achieve top sales among competitors in the region

Strong **objectives** meet the following criteria. They are:

- Aspirational

- Aligned with organizational goals

- Action-oriented

- Concrete

- Significant

To help shape each objective, ask yourself and your team:

- Does the objective help in achieving the project’s overall goals?

- Does the objective align with company and departmental OKRs?

- Is the objective inspiring and motivational?

- Will achieving the objective make a significant impact?

##### Develop key results

Next, add 2–3 key results for each objective. Key results should be time-bound. They can be used to indicate the amount of progress to achieve within a shorter period or to define whether you’ve met your objective at the end of the project. They should also challenge you and your team to stretch yourselves to achieve more.

###### Examples:

- X% new signups within first quarter post launch

- Increase advertiser spend by X%

- New feature adoption is at least X% 

- Maximum 2 critical bugs are reported by customers per Sprint

- Maintain newsletter unsubscribe rate at X%

Strong **key results** meet the following criteria:

- Results-oriented—not a task

- Measurable and verifiable

- Specific and time-bound

- Aggressive yet realistic

To help shape your key results, ask yourself and your team the following:

- What does success mean?

- What metrics would prove that we’ve successfully achieved the objective?

##### OKR development best practices
Here are some best practices to keep in mind when writing OKRs:

- Think of your objectives as being motivational and inspiring and your key results as being tactical and specific. The objective describes what you want to do and the key results describe how you’ll know you did it. 

- As a general rule, try to develop around 2–-3  key results for each objective.

- Be sure to document your OKRs and link to them in your project plan.

##### OKRs versus SMART goals

Earlier in this lesson, you learned how to craft SMART goals for your project. While SMART goals and OKRs have some similarities, there are key differences, as well. The following article describes how SMART goals and OKRs are similar, how they differ, and when you might want to use one or the other:  Understanding the Unique Utility of OKRs vs. SMART Goals

### Determining a project's scope video notes


Simply put, your project scope includes the boundaries of a project. 

You also need a firm understanding of the project's complexity. Is it straightforward with an easily manageable list of tasks? Or will it require extensive research, multiple rounds of approvals, and a large-scale production process that will take years to complete? 

Scope also includes the project timeline, budget, and resources.

***Now, how do you actually figure out the scope of your project? It's simple:*** 

**A:** talk to your sponsors and stakeholders, understand what their goals are, and find out what is, and this is really important, what is not included in the project. 

Here are a few more helpful questions to add to the list. 
 - Where did the project come from? 
 - Why is it needed? What is the project expected to achieve? 
 - What does the project sponsor have in mind? Who approves the final results?

As for timing, defining project **scope should happen during the initial planning stage.** You want to start figuring out the scope early on so that everyone can agree to the same set of expectations. It will help mitigate the risks of big changes down the line. Although you can always adjust the scope as planning continues, if you need to. Once you understand your project scope, you want to document all the details so that anyone can refer back to it throughout the life cycle of the project.  

---

### Monitoring and maintaining a project's scope video notes

**In-scope** - Tasks that are included in the project and contribute to the project's overall goal are considered to be in-scope. 

Tasks that aren't included are called **out-of-scope**. 

It's your job as a project manager to set and maintain firm boundaries for your project so that your team can stay on track.

Changes, growth, and uncontrolled factors that affect a project scope at any point after the project begins are referred to as **"scope creep."** Scope creep is a common problem, and it's not always easy to control. It's one that we struggle with on every single project.

To help you combat scope creep, it's good to know that there are two major sources from which it comes: external and internal. External sources of scope creep are easier to recognize.

While you can't control everything that happens, there are some useful tips to keep in mind. 

- First, make sure the stakeholders have visibility into the project. You want them to know the details of what's going to be produced, what resources are required, how much it will cost, and how much time it'll take. 

- Also, get clarity on the requirements and ask for constructive criticism of the initial product proposal. It's important to get this information before any contracts are signed. Be sure to set ground rules and expectations for stakeholder involvement once the project gets started. 

- Come to an agreement on each of your roles and responsibilities during execution and status reviews. Once you're clear on the project scope, come up with a plan for how to deal with out-of-scope requests. Agree on who can make formal change requests and how those requests will be evaluated, accepted, and performed. 

- And finally, be sure to get these agreements in writing. This way, you'll always have documentation to point if you, a stakeholder, or the customer have a disagreement down the line. One of the leading causes of external scope creep is not being clear on the requirements before defining the scope and getting formal approval to move forward with the project.

### Strategies for controlling scope creep

Scope management best practices
The scope of a project can get out of control quickly—so quickly that you may not even notice it. Scope creep is when a project’s work starts to grow beyond what was originally agreed upon during the initiation phase. Scope creep can put stress on you, your team, and your organization, and it can put your project at risk. The effects of scope creep can hinder every aspect of the project, from the schedule to the budget to the resources, and ultimately, its overall success. 

Here are some best practices for scope management and controlling scope creep: 

**Define your project’s requirements.** Communicate with your stakeholders or customers to find out exactly what they want from the project and document those requirements during the initiation phase. 

**Set a clear project schedule.** Time and task management are essential for sticking to your project’s scope. Your schedule should outline all of your project’s requirements and the tasks that are necessary to achieve them.

**Determine what is out of scope.** Make sure your stakeholders, customers, and project team understand when proposed changes are out of scope. Come to a clear agreement about the potential impacts to the project and document your agreement. 

**Provide alternatives.** Suggest alternative solutions to your customer or stakeholder. You can also help them consider how their proposed changes might create additional risks. Perform a cost-benefit analysis, if necessary.

**Set up a change control process.** During the course of your project, some changes are inevitable. Determine the process for how each change will be defined, reviewed, and approved (or rejected) before you add it to your project plan. Make sure your project team is aware of this process.

**Learn how to say no.** Sometimes you will have to say no to proposed changes. Saying no to a key stakeholder or customer can be uncomfortable, but it can be necessary to protect your project’s scope and its overall quality. If you are asked to take on additional tasks, explain how they will interfere with the budget, timeline, and/or resources defined in your initial project requirements. 

**Collect costs for out-of-scope work.** If out-of-scope work is required, be sure to document all costs incurred. That includes costs for work indirectly impacted by the increased scope. Be sure to indicate what the charges are for.

### Managing changes to a project's scope video notes

**The triple constraint model** is the combination of the three most significant restrictions of any project: 
- scope 
- time
- cost

**Time** refers to the project schedule and deadlines. **Cost** includes the budget, and it also covers resources and the people who will work on the project. Both time and budget have to be carefully managed alongside scope. All three of these are linked; you can't change one without having an impact on the others. 

***For example***, a decrease in cost means a change in time or scope. An increase in time means a change in scope or cost, or both. 

Understanding how changing one impacts the other two constraints is key. It's important to consider what trade-offs you're willing to make as the project progresses. To do this successfully, you need a clear understanding of the project priorities.

### Launching and landing a project video notes 


**Launch** - Delivering the final result of your project to the client or user is what's called a project launch. You finish building or creating a project, the tasks are completed, and the deliverables are done. You've hit your goal.

**Landing** is when you actually measure the success of your project using the success criteria established at the outset of the project. final outcome to the test.

---
### Reading: Don't forget to land: Measuring project success

##### Launching vs. landing a project
In project management, a project “launching” means you have delivered the final results of the project to the client or user. You can’t solely base project success on when the client accepts the project, though. Your work on a project won’t be complete until you “land” it by thoroughly measuring the results. This is when the success criteria and the metrics you defined initially when setting SMART goals will come in handy.  

Teams should be clear on what they are trying to accomplish, beyond just launching something to users. Will your project increase retention? Will your project speed up a product feature? Depending on the product and situation, the answers will differ, but it is important that your team aligns and works toward the same measurable goal. 

##### Launch first, land later
Let’s consider an example: imagine you are a project manager for an eco-friendly organization. Your organization asks you to create a training program for middle school students in your county to teach them about the impacts of recycling. The county's goal is to increase recycling by 20% over the next five years. You gather your team and start developing the learning content to build out this training program. It takes you and your team one year to complete the research, development, and production of this training. When you hand over the training to the school district, you are launching the project. In order to know your project actually landed at the intended goal, you need to check back in periodically over the next five years to see if the training program is on target to produce a 20% increase in recycling in the county.  

##### Launch and forget
A common mistake of many project teams is to “launch and forget” the results. This happens when a project manager delivers the project to the client and the client accepts the project delivery, but the project manager doesn’t assess if the project deliverables satisfy the customer or user. In the example above, if you didn’t check back periodically over five years to assess the results, you would have only launched—but not landed—the project. Launching and landings work in tandem to ensure true success. 

A project landing shouldn’t create more hurdles. If done correctly, a landing creates greater alignment within the teams on the end results you all desire, and it gives everybody on the team better visibility on how to achieve success.

### Defining success criteria video notes


The **success criteria** will tell you whether or not the project as a whole was successful. They are the specific details of your goals and deliverables that tell you whether you've accomplished what you set out to do. They are the standards by which the project will be judged once it's been delivered to stakeholders and customers. 

Determining Project Success

You can measure to determine your project success in a similar way to measuring a goal. So go through your project goals and deliverables, review the scope, and identify the measurable aspects of your project. These are going to be any of the metrics used in the goals and deliverables, along with your budget and schedule details. 

- Another thing you'll need to do is get clarity from stakeholders on the project requirements and expectations.

**Adoption metrics** refers to how the customer uses and adopts a product or service without any issues. Engagement refers to how often or meaningful customer interaction and participation is over time.

Tracking how many customers renew their Plant Pals service, post about it, or share feedback are **engagement metrics.**

**There are many different ways to measure success**. The key is to pick the methods that work best for your success criteria. It's a good idea that, along with each success criteria on your list, to also include the methods for 
- how success will be measured, 
- how often it's measured, and 
- who's responsible for measuring it. 

Share your success criteria document with your stakeholders and ask if they agree with how the project's success will be determined. It's also a good idea to have the appropriate stakeholders sign off on the success criteria. 

Defining your success criteria should create greater alignment within the team and give everybody better visibility into how to achieve success. Clarity around success metrics also helps teams prioritize which efforts are most impactful to their users.

##### Product quality 

The product, or final result, of a project has its own set of attributes that define success. The product attributes that are necessary for the product’s success include completeness in features, quality of features, unit cost, usability, etc. The extent that a product is complete will contribute to the product’s success. This can apply to any project in which you deliver a product or tangible outcome at the end. To keep us on track for success, we can create a list of product requirements to ensure that you do not miss anything. For example, if the project produces word processing software, you need basic features like text entry, formatting, saving, and printing. Since you require each feature to have a functional word processor by today’s standards, you include these features on your checklist. 

To measure the success of a product, consider including these metrics on your checklist: 

- Track if you implemented the product’s priority requirements

- Track and assess the product’s number of technical issues or defects

- Measure the percentage of features you delivered or released at the end of the project

#### What is important to the customers or stakeholders 

We have to pay attention to product metrics, but we also have to be mindful of stakeholder and customer additional expectations for features and objectives. In the word processor example, a stakeholder may want to add an additional functionality to easily create tables in a document with text. Additionally, a strategic goal of the organization could be to create word processor software with more collaborative ability than the word processors currently on the market. Each component is necessary in order to meet customer and stakeholder expectations. Think about what needs the project satisfies for your stakeholders or customers. These strategic goals tie back to the business case and the reason you initiated the project in the first place. Often, you can measure the fulfillment of strategic goals via user or customer metrics. Metrics to consider include:

- Evaluating user engagement with the product 

- Measuring stakeholder and customer satisfaction via surveys

- Tracking user adoption of the product by using sales data

#### Document, align, and communicate success

Understanding where we are and where we are going helps the project team determine if they are on track. As you learned in the video on this topic, you need to get clarity from stakeholders on the project requirements and expectations. There are many people involved with any project, and success will look different for each of them. You want to ask questions, such as: Who ultimately says whether or not the project is successful? What criteria will be measured to determine success? What is the success of this project based on? It is best practice to get the key stakeholders or the steering committee to review and approve your success criteria. This becomes a mutual agreement on how all parties define the success of the project.

### Introduction: Working effectively with stakeholders video notes

**stakeholders** play a pivotal role. They are people who are interested in and affected by the project's completion and success.

### Choosing a project team video notes

When choosing a team, consider: 

- **Required roles** - First, a project manager will make a list of roles that they'll need on their team to complete each task.
- **Team size** -  the project manager decides how many people they'll need on their team. This can vary greatly depending on the project size. For small projects, a team may only need three or four people to complete the deliverables on time, and for larger projects, a team might include dozens. 
- **Necessary skills** - To decide on the right person for each role, a project manager needs to think carefully about skills. It's on the project manager to ensure that everyone on the team has the right skills to do the job, but it's also important to remember that skills can be taught. If someone doesn't have a certain skill initially, they might still be a great fit for the team.
- **Availability** - When choosing teammates, a project manager also has to factor in each person's availability and whether they'll feel motivated to complete their assigned tasks.

It can be helpful to look deeper into each task on the project. Always ask yourself these key questions: 
- How many people do I need on my team each step of the way? 
- Which team members do I need and when? 
- Are those experts already busy on other projects? 
- Who makes the final decisions on project resources?

### Reading: Review: The building blocks of a project dream team

##### Too big, too small, or just right?
Once you lay the foundation for your project by outlining your goals and expectations, it is time to build your dream team! Though before we can build our dream team, we need to figure out how many people we need. This number will largely depend on the size of the project itself. Complex projects with large divisions of work will usually require larger project teams. Simple projects with straightforward expectations may only require a few people on the project team. As a project manager, it is your job to help find the right balance based on what is needed.

The right skills and abilities to fill the role
Multiple roles exist in every project. On smaller teams, multiple roles may be filled by one person. To meet the needs of more specialized projects, project managers might require people who have the necessary technical skills. Technical skills are the skills specific to the task that needs to be performed. For example, on the Office Green project, necessary **technical skills** may include indoor landscaping design for the layout of the plants within the offices and floral design of plant arranging.  

Technical skills are highly valued, but they are not the only skills that are important for high functioning teams. Interpersonal skills, also known as people skills or soft skills, such as patience and conflict mediation, can help team members. This allows the team to blend their technical expertise with collaborative skills in order to get the job done. When a team applies their interpersonal skills, they can minimize team-related issues. 

**Problem-solving skills** are a must for all team members, especially when it comes to large, complex projects. As a project manager, you will not be able to solve every problem for your team. At some point, they will need to use their own judgment to problem-solve and get the work done. 

An underrated skill set for project team members are leadership skills. **Strong leadership skills** help team members navigate organizational boundaries and effectively communicate with stakeholders to generate buy-in. 

##### Who is available?

In projects, the availability of your team is always a big concern. This is especially true in Matrix organizations, where team members have multiple bosses. It is not uncommon to pull a team member onto another project before your project is complete. In a perfect world, you only pick those who can stay on the project for its entire life cycle. You may find that you don’t get to pick certain members of your team at all, which is called a pre-assignment. In these cases, the sponsor assigns team members to your project.

Keep in mind that you need to value diversity early on when building your team. On diverse teams, everyone is able to use their unique professional and personal experiences to contribute to a more successful project. Diversity is best leveraged when it is acknowledged and highlighted as an asset. Many people avoid discussing their differences, but if you encourage those conversations, you will find a richer understanding and greater creativity that comes from people working together across identity differences. To do this effectively, it is important to dedicate time early on in the team building process to develop trust between team members. Team members who understand one another are more likely to trust each other and feel safe sharing different points of view or offer a competing perspective. This will also allow them to more easily offer constructive feedback or be supportive if the team dynamics face challenges at any point.

##### What motivates them?

Be sure to take note of the motivation level of your team members and the impact it may have on your project. Just because a person is pre-assigned to a project, doesn’t necessarily mean they have low interest in it, but a person who proactively volunteered for it may have additional motivation to do the work.

As a project manager, it is your responsibility to engage your team and keep them motivated. This is where your influence as a leader is required to keep the team engaged and ready to overcome any obstacles that may appear. Engaging in a respectful manner and maintaining a positive outlook with your team during times of adversity are simple ways to keep your team motivated.

### Defining project roles video notes

To feel confident in your team, you need to know each person's role from the start. Clearly laying out the responsibilities for each role helps everyone know what project tasks they're accountable for.

**Team members** are the heart of the operation. They're the people doing the day to day work and making the project happen. 

**The customers** are the people who will get some sort of value from a successfully landed project.

**Users** are the people that ultimately use the product that your project will produce. 

**Stakeholders** are anyone involved in the project; those who have a vested interest in the project's success. 

**Primary stakeholders** are people who expect to benefit directly from the project's completion, while **secondary stakeholders** play an intermediary role and are indirectly impacted by the project.

A **project sponsor** is the person who is accountable for the project and who ensures the project delivers the agreed upon value to the business. They play a vital leadership role throughout the process. Sometimes they fund the project.

**Project manager**: the person who plans, organizes and oversees the whole project.

### Completing a stakeholder analysis video notes


There are three key steps to kicking off a stakeholder analysis:

1. First, make a list of all the stakeholders that the project impacts. 
2. Then determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder. 
3. Assess their ability to participate, and find ways to involve them.

**Influence** measures how much power a stakeholder has and how much the stakeholder's actions affect the project outcome. 

 The **power grid** is a super useful two-by-two grid used for conducting a stakeholder analysis. We use the power grid to assign each stakeholder's level of importance to the project, measuring their interest and influence. The position of the stakeholder on the grid usually determines their active role in the project. The higher the interest and influence, the more important the stakeholder is to the project's success. 

 You may also want to create a **steering committee** made up of a high influence and high interest stakeholders. These people will be the most senior decision-making body on any project. They have the authority to make changes to budget and approve updates to timeline or scope. 
 
 **The project manager isn't a member of the steering committee**, but they're responsible for bringing the right project information to the steering committee so that decisions can be quickly made. 

**Stakeholder buy-in** is the process of involving these people in decision-making to hopefully reach a broader consensus on the organization's future. You'll want to explain to them how the project will help them achieve their goals, and you want to have their support later on if any issues come up.

### Reading Prioritizing stakeholders and generating their buy-in

#### Conducting a stakeholder analysis 

**Stakeholders** are an essential part of any project. A project manager’s ability to balance stakeholder requirements, get their buy-in, and understand when and how to involve them is key to successfully fulfilling a project.  

It is key to keep stakeholders organized in order to understand when and how to involve them at the right time. In an earlier video, we introduced the **stakeholder analysis**, a useful tool that project managers use to understand stakeholders’ needs and help minimize hiccups during your project life cycle. 

Let’s review the key steps in the stakeholder analysis:

1. Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts. When generating this list, ask yourself: Who is invested in the project? Who is impacted by this project? Who contributes to this project? 

2. Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder—this step helps you determine who your key stakeholders are. The higher the level of interest and influence, the more important it will be to prioritize their needs throughout the project. 

3. Assess stakeholders’ ability to participate and then find ways to involve them. Various types of projects will yield various types of stakeholders—some will be **active stakeholders** with more opinions and touchpoints and others will be **passive stakeholders**, preferring only high-level updates and not involved in the day-to-day. That said, just because a stakeholder does not participate as often as others does not mean they are not important. There are lots of factors that will play a role in determining a stakeholder’s ability to participate in a project, like physical distance from the project and their existing workload. 

**Pro tip:** You might want to form a **steering committee** during some projects. A steering committee is a collection of key stakeholders who have a high level of power and interest in a project. A steering committee can influence multiple departments within the organization, which means that they have the potential to release a greater number of resources to the project manager.  

##### Visualizing your analysis

A **power grid** shows stakeholder interest *in* the project versus their influence over the project. This four-quadrant tool helps project managers evaluate how to manage their stakeholders. It is used to determine the appropriate level of engagement required by the project team needed to gain the stakeholders’ trust and buy-in.

Take the time at the start of the project to establish your stakeholder approach. List the stakeholders and then place them into the appropriate places on the grid. Being able to visualize their placement will help you manage communications and expectations. Having a quick reference tool to drive your communication actions will also allow you to have the ability to spend more time doing other tasks on your project. 

**Pro tip:** While these tools help organize information, they do not necessarily make the difference between successful and unsuccessful stakeholder engagement. **What will make for successful stakeholder engagement is the project manager’s ability to know their stakeholders’ motivations and inspirations.** This takes time, interpersonal skills, and insight into the organization’s internal political workings. Remember, each project is different, and your project may need tweaks along the way as you grow as a project manager. Making necessary changes means you are doing something right. Just make sure to check in and ensure that you are well on track, engaging your stakeholders successfully, and delivering on your project!

##### Generating stakeholder buy-in 

Once you organize and assess your stakeholders, it is time to start making some decisions on whose buy-in is absolutely necessary for success, whose requirements deserve the most attention, and what level of communication each stakeholder will require.

Gaining key stakeholder buy-in is essential to ensuring that your project is not deprioritized or deprived of resources. 

Tips for gaining key stakeholder buy-in include: 

- Clearly mapping the work of the project to the goals of the stakeholder.

- Describing how the project aligns with the goals of the stakeholder's department or team.

- Listening to feedback from the stakeholder and finding ways to incorporate their feedback into the project's charter where appropriate.

Manage your stakeholders’ expectations by presenting a realistic view of your team’s abilities. Do not over-promise and under-deliver!

### Elements of a RACI chart video notes

A RACI chart helps to define roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams to ensure work gets done efficiently. It creates clear roles and gives direction for each team member. 

There are four types of participation included in a RACI chart. These are: 
- **R**esponsible
- **A**ccountable 
- **C**onsulted
- **I**nformed 

**Responsible** refers to those doing the work to complete the task. **Accountable** refers to those making sure the work gets done. **Consulted** includes those giving feedback, like subject matter experts or decision-makers. And lastly, we have **informed**, which includes those just needing to know the final decisions or that a task is complete. 

---
### Reading Building out a RACI chart

##### Elements of a RACI chart

A RACI chart creates clear roles and gives direction to each team member and stakeholder. Over your career, you may hear a RACI chart referred to as a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM), RACI diagram, or RACI matrix. The ultimate goal of this chart is to clarify each person’s role on your project. 

First, let’s break down each of the roles people can be assigned:

**R**: Responsible: who gets the work done

**A**: Accountable: who makes sure the work is done

**C**: Consulted: who gives input or feedback on work

**I**: Informed: who needs to know the outcome

The RACI chart is a valuable tool. It can help you define and document project roles and responsibilities, give direction to each team member and stakeholder, and ensure work gets done efficiently. A RACI chart can also help you analyze and balance the workload of your team. While it may take many revisions to make sure that your team members and stakeholders are being placed into the right roles in your RACI chart, doing this work up front helps save time and prevent miscommunications later on. 

---

##### Workload balance 

Are there too many tasks assigned to one stakeholder? When you complete your chart, it is a good idea to go back through and tally the number of Rs assigned to each stakeholder. This can help you identify potentially overloading one team member with work. Using a RACI chart to determine responsibility for tasks can help mitigate single points of failure (known as creating **silos**, where the knowledge and responsibility for a task falls on one person) and allow you, as the project manager, to delegate tasks and avoid burnout. Maintaining workload balance is a critical part of project management. It is easy to fall into the pattern of relying on your top performers to keep the project moving forward. But this isn’t always healthy for the project or your team. If you find that you don’t have the right people to assign responsibilities to, take a step back and evaluate your team. 

##### Put your RACI into practice
Once you have created your RACI chart, it is time to put it into practice. You will first need to share your RACI chart with your sponsors and stakeholders to get buy-in and sign-off. When you get stakeholder buy-in, you will be able to set clear expectations for your team and ensure that everyone is aligned on their responsibilities. 

You can document your team and stakeholders’ acknowledgment of these expectations through the project charter, meeting notes, and in the RACI chart itself. Think back to a time when you were expected to do something you did not agree with, or weren’t clear on. That disagreement or lack of clarity made it difficult to do your best work, right? Getting buy-in and continually checking in with your stakeholders and your team is the way to avoid this potential pitfall! 

As you take the time to ensure that each task has an owner identified with the appropriate level of engagement, you are streamlining your communication and decision-making process over the life cycle of your project. 

##### When should you use a RACI chart?
If you are wondering if you should use a RACI chart on your project, it is a good idea to evaluate the complexity of the effort. For example, if you have a very small project team with a small amount of stakeholders, clearly defined roles, and a short timeline, introducing a RACI chart could possibly slow down the project. However, larger projects, or even projects that involve a large number of stakeholders, could greatly benefit from a RACI chart. It is always a good idea to work through the creation of a RACI chart and evaluate the outcome. Even if you do not end up using the RACI chart, you will have a better understanding of the project, and your effort will contribute to your project management experience overall.

### Essential project resources video notes

A **budget** is an estimate of the amount of money a project will cost to complete.

When we talk about **resources**, we're also talking about the team of people who help execute the tasks of a project. For example, you, as the project manager are a resource. So is the marketing manager who might create advertisements for this new product. Other resources can include people outside of your company who have unique skills and can do certain tasks that people in your organization can't do personally.

Then, you have **materials**. These are items you need to help get the project done. For example, project materials might include the lumber needed to complete a construction project, okay? So you know that project resources include budget, people, and materials.

**Tools** are aids that make it easier for a project manager or team to manage resources and organize work. They help you do things like track tasks, manage budgets, and collaborate with teammates. 

They help you do things like track tasks, manage budgets, and collaborate with teammates.

### Reading: Managing resources to get the job done

As we continue learning the tools and techniques that will help you succeed in project management, let’s consider the importance of **project resources**. Project resources are who and what you depend on to complete a project, including budget, materials, and people. While each resource is a separate entity, they all depend on one another—your team cannot do the work without materials, and you cannot purchase materials without a budget. In this reading, we will discuss some key project resources and tips for managing them.

#### Budget

Have you ever created a budget for yourself or your family? If you have, you know that a budget includes a wide variety of expenses. For example, a monthly personal budget can contain items that include anything from food to transportation costs to rent. With only a certain amount of funding to cover each expense, it is important to closely monitor your spending to avoid going over budget. If you go over in one category of your budget, you will impact the others and will need to make adjustments. As a project manager, you will take the same general approach with your project budget. 

Common aspects of your project budget will include:

- Team: the cost of the people performing the work

- Services: any outside vendors helping your project

- Materials: any tangible items purchased to complete the project

Throughout your project management career, you will encounter various types of projects with a wide range of budgets. Some budgets will have no margin for error, whereas other budgets may be more flexible. Regardless of this variability, budget issues will inevitably arise, so it is important to make sure that the budget is aligned with the project scope and the stakeholders’ asks. 

#### People

People are a vital resource on your project; you cannot complete your project on your own! You will need to rely on a strong team of people with a variety of skill sets and specialties to get the job done. As a project manager, make sure that you have commitment and buy-in on the number of hours it will take for your resources to complete their tasks. Additionally, you will find the best partners on a project are people who are aligned to the goals of the project or who are most interested in the project's work.

#### Materials

Materials can be different on every project. For example, if you were working on an IT project, materials could include hard drives and computers to handle the coding efforts. You can also have materials that are intangible. For example, on the same IT project, online storage, software programs, or employee training may also be considered materials. It is important to account for any and all potential materials in order to execute a successful project with the right people and within budget.

### The value of project documentation video notes

Clear and consistent documentation can ensure transparency and clear communication. 

Documentation helps set the stage for the project. It communicates the answers to key questions. 

For example: 

- What problem are you trying to solve? 
- What are the project goals? 
- What are the scope and deliverables, and who are the project's stakeholders? 
- What resources does the team need to complete their work?

Documentation also helps preserve decisions made early on in the project and can serve as a reference point for team members who might join later in the project life cycle. 

Documenting decisions can help you uncover:
- tasks 
- timelines 
- costs you hadn't previously considered
- process provides a historical record that can be reviewed at the end of your project

### Project proposals and charters 101 video notes

typically, a senior organizational leader creates the proposal. So you might not need to worry about creating the proposal, but you will have to keep track of the proposal's progress.

These are: the project proposal and the project charter. A **project proposal** is a form of documentation that comes at the very beginning of the project. This document's purpose is to persuade stakeholders that a project should begin.

A proposal may be a formal document, a presentation, or even a simple email to get others on board with the idea. 

the **project charter**: a formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details to reach its goals. A project charter helps you get organized, set up a framework for what needs to be done, and communicate those details to others. 

As you learned earlier in this course, there are a few questions you might ask yourself when performing a cost benefit analysis. 

The project charter makes clear that the benefits of the project outweigh the costs.

That includes questions like: 
- What value will this project create? 
- How much money could this project save my organization? 
- How much time will people have to spend on this project? 
- You'll include the answers to these questions in your charter. 

Including this type of information ensures that you and your stakeholders agree on the project value. 

##### Project charter vs Project proposal 

So how do these documents differ? A project proposal is created earlier in the project life cycle than the project charter.

The proposal kicks off the initiation phase by influencing and persuading the company to move forward with the project. 

The project charter serves a similar purpose and often comes at the end of the initiation phase. However, its goal is to more clearly define the key details of the project. 

Another difference between these two documents is that a charter will often serve as a point of reference throughout the life of a project. The proposal is only used at the earlier stages.

**END of explaination---**

The project charter makes clear that the benefits of the project outweigh the costs. 

As you learned earlier in this course, there are a few questions you might ask yourself when performing a cost benefit analysis. That includes questions like: 

- What value will this project create? 
- How much money could this project save my organization? 
- How much time will people have to spend on this project? 

You'll include the answers to these questions in your charter. Including this type of information ensures that you and your stakeholders agree on the project value. 

**The charter also helps ensure that you and your stakeholders agree on the details of the project.**

Creating a project charter is a best practice for ensuring that everyone agrees on how to move forward before entering the planning phase. 

The project charter is a living document. This means that it can evolve as the project progresses. As the project manager, you'll review and refine the charter throughout the process.

### Reading: Project charters: Elements and formats

A project charter clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details for the project to reach its goals. A well-documented project charter can be a project manager’s secret weapon to success. In this reading, we will go over the function, key elements, and significance of a project charter and learn how to create one. 

The charter is the formal way that the project’s goals, values, benefits, and details are captured. You can think of the charter as the compass for your project since you will use it throughout the life cycle of the project. Many stakeholders will look to your project charter to ensure that you are indeed aligned with strategic goals and set up for achieving the desired end goal. Since the project charter carries so much importance, it is important to incorporate the right amount of detail while omitting miscellaneous elements.

As with any of your project documents, it is a good idea to collaborate with your team and stakeholders early and often. Developing the project charter in collaboration with both groups can help you make sure that your project charter addresses your key stakeholders’ most important concerns and keeps your team aligned. Be sure to use the business case—the reason for initiating the project—as the guiding direction to your project charter. Project charters can vary from organization to organization and from project to project. It is key for a project manager to identify the best type of charter for the project in order to capture the relevant information and set your project up for success. 

Project charters will vary but usually include some combination of the following key information:

- introduction/project summary

- goals/objectives 

- business case/benefits and costs

- project team

- scope

- success criteria

- major requirements or key deliverables

- budget

- schedule/timeline or milestones

- constraints and assumptions

- risks

- OKRs

- approvals

You will likely use many different project charter formats throughout your project management career.

For more complex projects, you may link to additional analysis or documents. You can house these items in the appendix. 

Your organization may have a unique template for you to use, or you may have the flexibility to leverage one you come across in your career. As your project progresses, you may also encounter revisions to your project charter—and that is okay. Remember, it is a living document; let it grow with your project, and review and revisit it often to ensure you are aligned.

### Introducing new tools to a team

Project management tools and processes are always evolving. In this reading, we will discuss the importance of choosing the right tools for a project and the implications of introducing new tools to your team. 

As a project manager, it is important to be open to implementing new tools that may be beneficial to a project's outcome. You will experience change in lots of forms throughout your project’s life cycle, and navigating change is essential. But if you choose to implement a tool that your team is unfamiliar with—especially if you decide to roll it out midway through a project—your team may be hesitant. People embrace change differently, particularly if the change will directly impact their routine and the way they work. Simply put: Change can be met with resistance.

Before you introduce a new tool to your team, you should be sure that this change is actually going to benefit the project, and ensure that those involved in your project understand the benefits of this change. Demonstrating to your teammates and stakeholders that you understand the tool and have evaluated its competency will help build trust, especially if this new tool is replacing an existing tool. Taking the time to introduce the new tool to your team members will also demonstrate that you have the best interest of the team in mind—not just the success of the project. 

Here are some important considerations and keys to successfully introducing new tools:

**Discuss the tool early and often, if possible.** The team should not feel blindsided by a new change. Make sure they know the change is coming as early as possible. This will help them prepare for an introduction or migration to the new tool.

**Ask for feedback from key stakeholders.** You could get great feedback on features that you may have overlooked without asking for their expertise. You can solicit this feedback by requesting their input about functionality or have them list features in order of priority. The key is to create an opportunity for stakeholders to provide their feedback and allow you to incorporate their feedback into next steps.

**Involve the key stakeholders in demonstrations as you get closer to making the final decision on the project tracking tool.** You will be able to leverage key stakeholders' acceptance by letting them test the product or sign up for a trial run. It is also important to make sure that the tool is actually going to meet the mark and provide a meaningful change for the project. You may want to pull in key users from your team to test and familiarize themselves with the tool prior to rolling it out. This will allow the team to get on board with your plans or discuss their concerns beforehand. This will also highlight in-house experts for future training, assistance, and implementation.

**Ensure the tool is fully functional before the team is introduced to it.** Whenever possible, hold off from introducing the tool if it still has any issues. Make sure the tool is accessible for all users. Keep in mind, your team members may resist a tool that doesn’t live up to how it is supposed to function. This will impact implementation and acceptance fairly significantly, so put your best tool forward!

**Set up training for the tool as needed before you ask the team to actually use it.** Everyone has different levels of comfort with different tools. It is your job as the project manager to ensure that each team members’ needs are addressed. Setting up training also helps create positive first impressions, which will lead to higher productivity and quicker, more successful implementation and acceptance.

Remember, some pushback is normal, but successful project managers should take the steps to prepare and mitigate any friction for their team when possible. 

**Pro tip:** If time allows, plan for a period of transition if you are replacing an existing tool. It is common to allow both tools to operate during this period. You will need to “sunset,” or retire, the existing tool eventually, but allowing for a period of transition between using the old tool and the new tool can help stakeholders and team members feel more at ease and give them time to gain familiarity with the new tool. Be prepared for productivity to be impacted as the team transitions from one tool to another.

### Exploring types of project management tools video notes

So, why would you choose to use scheduling and work management software? Well, it can be really useful for assigning tasks to multiple teammates and for tracking progress on that work. It can also help you visualize your team's progress.
