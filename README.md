### Key components of project initiation video notes

There are several key components of initiation that you need to consider in order for your project to be successful: 

**goals** -  the goal is what you've been asked to do and what you're trying to achieve. All projects should have clear goals and often those will be determined by senior company leaders, with your help.

**scope** -  the process to define the work that needs to happen to complete the project.
You also need to think about project deliverables. They're the products and services that you will create for your customer, client or project sponsor.

**deliverables** -  They're the products and services that you will create for your customer, client or project sponsor. Deliverables can be anything from product features and functionalities to documentation, processes and more, anything that enables the goal of your project to be achieved. Deliverables are submitted to help you reach your project goals.

**success criteria** - Success criteria are the standards by which you measure how successful a project was in reaching its goals.

**stakeholders** -  Stakeholders are key to making informed decisions at every step of the project, including the initiation phase.
They're the people who both have interest in and are affected by the completion and success of a project.

**resources** - resources generally refer to the budget, people, materials, and other items that you will have at your disposal. It's super important to think carefully about these pieces early on.


Finally, once you've established your goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders, and resources, it's time to create a project charter. A **project charter** is a document that contains all the details of the project. Project charters clearly define the project and its goals and outline what is needed to accomplish them. A project charter allows you to get organized, set up a framework for what needs to be done and communicate those details to others.

### Reflection: Project initiation and key components 

Question 1
In this exercise, you will read a scenario and identify the six key components of project initiation:

- Goals

- Scope

- Project deliverables

- Success criteria

- Stakeholders

- Resources

Start by reading the scenario:

Imagine you are a project manager at an educational software company. You’re assigned a new project to develop a digital grading platform for a local high school. Before beginning the project, you meet with teachers, school administrators, the school IT department, and the district superintendent to discuss the project and get their input. 

During these meetings, you organized your thoughts by writing down project key components that the stakeholders have requested. Your notes on the key components are:

- $150,000 maximum budget  

- Team: can add one member from the school IT department  

- Platform should allow teachers to enter grades and allow students/parents to view grades  

- Need full teacher buy-in at high school: 100% adoption within next nine months   

- Project should focus only on the digital grading platform and NOT impact other digital platforms (ex. attendance, school lunch payments)  

- Overall, the school is seeking a platform for digital grading 

The next step in the project is to organize the key components into a project charter. You will then present the charter to the individuals involved with the project. The project charter ensures everyone is aligned before planning and then executing the project.

***Which of the key components is the project’s goal? Write one sentence.***

**A:** The project’s goal is what you’ve been asked to do and what you’re trying to achieve. The goals are often determined by senior leaders at an organization or company. Did you consider the goal as: To launch a digital grading platform for the high school and get full teacher adoption? 

***Which key component outlines the project’s scope? Write one sentence.***

**A:** Project managers use scope as a boundary—what should or shouldn’t be included in the project. In the scenario above, the project scope is: Creating the digital grading platform and not updating other digital platforms the school uses such as attendance or meal payments. 

***Which key component is the project deliverable? Write one sentence.***

**A:** A deliverable is the tangible and intangible outcomes of a project. The deliverables in the examples are: A platform for teachers to enter grades and students to view their grades.

***Which key component outlines the project’s success criteria? Write one sentence.***

**A:** The success criteria are the standards by which you measure how successful a project is in reaching its goals. Did you consider: 100% of teachers adopt the digital grading platform within the next nine months? 

***Who are the project stakeholders? Write one sentence.***

**A:** Stakeholders are people who have an interest in, or are affected by, the completion of a successful project: teachers, students, parents, school administrators, school IT department, and the district superintendent. 

***Which key components outline the resources you will have at your disposal for the project?***

**A:** Resources generally refer to the budget, people, and materials available to complete the project. In the scenario, it’s the budget of $150,000 and the member from the school’s IT department.

### Performing a cost-benefit analysis

Previously, you learned that a cost-benefit analysis is the process of adding up the expected value of a project—the benefits—and comparing them to the dollar costs. In this reading, we will discuss the benefits of conducting a cost-benefit analysis, guiding questions to help you and your stakeholders conduct one, and how to calculate return on investment (ROI).

##### The benefits of a cost-benefit analysis

A cost-benefit analysis can minimize risks and maximize gains for projects and organizations. It can help you communicate clearly with stakeholders and executives and keep your project on track. Because this type of analysis uses objective data, it can help reduce biases and keep stakeholder self-interest from influencing decisions. 

Comparing a project’s benefits to its costs can help you make a strong business case to stakeholders and leadership and ensure your organization pursues the most profitable or useful projects. Organizations use cost-benefit analyses to reduce waste and invest their resources responsibly.

##### Guiding questions for a cost-benefit analysis

When you’re pursuing a project, the benefits should outweigh the costs. It’s important for you and your stakeholders to consider questions like the ones that follow early on, while you prepare the proposal.

To determine the benefits of a project, you might ask:

- ***What value will this project create?*** 

- ***How much money could this project save our organization?*** 

- ***How much money will it bring in from existing customers?***

- ***How much time will it save?*** 

- ***How will it improve the customer experience?***

And to determine the costs of a project, consider questions such as:

- ***How much time will people have to spend on this project?***

- ***What are the one-time costs?***

- ***Are there any ongoing costs?***

- ***What about long-term costs?*** 

You might also consider questions about intangible benefits. These are gains that are not quantifiable, such as:

- **Customer satisfaction**. Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services? 

- **Employee satisfaction.** Is the project likely to improve employee morale, reducing turnover? 

- **Employee productivity.** Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?

- **Brand perception.** Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?

You can also flip these questions to consider intangible costs. These are costs that are not quantifiable. For example, might the project put customer retention, employee satisfaction, or brand perception at risk?

When assigning values to tangible or intangible costs and benefits, you can reference similar past projects, conduct industry research, or consult with experts.

Calculating costs and benefits
The process of calculating costs and benefits is also called calculating **return on investment**, or **ROI**. There are many ways to determine a project’s ROI, but the easiest way is to compare the upfront and ongoing costs to its benefits over time.

One common ROI formula is:
### ` (G-C) / C = ROI`

In this formula, G represents the financial gains you expect from the project, and C represents the upfront and ongoing costs of your investment in the project.

For example, imagine your project costs $6,000 up front plus $25 per month for 12 months. This equals $300 per year, but you estimate that the project will bring in $10,000 in revenue over the course of that year. Using the formula above, you calculate the ROI as: ($10,000 - $6,300) ÷ $6,300 = 0.58 = 58%

The ROI comes to 0.58, or 58%. You consider this to be a strong ROI, so you decide to pursue the project.

### How to set SMART goals video notes

***What can help create a measurable goal? Select all that apply.***


**A:** It’s important for project managers to set well-defined goals. That’s why SMART goals are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. Metrics, such as figures or numbers, make goals measurable. The accuracy of metrics are confirmed with points of reference, called **benchmarks**.

**A:** SMART goals are well-defined goals that help keep projects on track. They’re specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. SMART goals are measured with figures or numbers known as metrics. Benchmarks are used to help confirm the accuracy of **metrics**.

### Reading SMART goals: Making goals meaningful

In this lesson you are learning to define and create measurable project goals and deliverables. Now, let's focus on SMART goals.

**Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant,** and **Time-bound (SMART)** goals are very helpful for ensuring project success. As you start your career in project management, you may not directly set the project goals, but you should be able to clarify and understand them. SMART goals help you see the full scope of a goal, determine its feasibility, and clearly define project success in concrete terms. 

Let’s recap what we discussed in the previous video by taking a look at a breakdown of the criteria for SMART goals below: 

- **Specific:** The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret. 

- **Measurable:** Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.

- **Attainable:** The project team agrees the objective is realistic.

- **Relevant:** The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.

- **Time-bound:** The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.

You may see variations on what each letter in the “SMART” acronym stands for. (For example, you may see “actionable” or “achievable” instead of “attainable” or “realistic” instead of “relevant.”) However, the general intent of each of these terms—to make sure the goal is within reach—is always similar.

##### Focusing on the "M" in SMART

Let’s take a moment to zoom in on the **M** in SMART, which stands for measurable. Having **measurable** goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics, such as dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc. Measurable goals are important because they leave little room for confusion around expectations from stakeholders. 

Not every metric will have value, so you will have to determine which metrics make sense for the project. For example, measuring how many meetings the software engineers on your project attend on a weekly basis may not be the most valuable metric for a productivity goal. Alternatively, you might measure other aspects of the engineers’ productivity, such as a particular number of features created per engineer or a specific number of issues flagged per day.

##### Defining a SMART goal

Let’s explore an example related to making a personal goal measurable. Imagine you are looking to make a career change, and you set a goal to complete a Google Career Certificate. You can **measure** the success of this goal because after completing the entire program, you will receive a certificate—a tangible outcome.

Now, let’s determine how to make the remaining elements of this goal SMART. In this example, your **specific** goal is to attain a Google Career Certificate. You can make this goal attainable by deciding that you will complete one course per month. This goal is **relevant** because it supports your desire to make a career change. Finally, you can make this goal **time-bound** by deciding that you will complete the program within six months.

After defining each of these components, your SMART goal then becomes: Obtain a Google Career Certificate by taking one course per month within the next six months.

### Activity: Define and determine SMART project goals

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

Office Green, LLC, is a commercial landscaping company that specializes in plant decor for offices and other businesses. The company is getting ready to introduce its new Plant Pals service, which will provide high-volume customers with small, low-maintenance plants for their desks. You are the project manager assigned to manage the Plant Pals launch.

Office Green’s main goal for this project is: “Increase revenue by 5% by the end of the year by rolling out a new service that provides office plants to high-volume clients.”

You recently met with the project sponsor (the Director of Product) to discuss two additional goals for the Plant Pals project:

1. Boost Office Green’s brand awareness

2. Raise Office Green’s customer retention rate

In order to help your team achieve these two additional project goals, you need to turn them into SMART goals. The notes from your meeting with the Director of Product are below. You can use this information to create SMART goals:

- Office Green’s customer retention rate was 80% last year, but the CEO wants that number to increase by at least 10% this year.

- Last year, 70% of customers who left Office Green for competitors said they did so because they wanted more extensive services. When surveyed, 85% of existing customers expressed an interest in Plant Pals.

- The Vice President of Customer Success expects Office Green to achieve a customer satisfaction rating of over 90% this year—a slight increase over last year. The rating has stayed between 85%-90% for the last five years.

- The company plans to create an Operations and Training plan for Plant Pals to improve on existing customer service standards and boost efficiency.

- Office Green will promote the new service with a new marketing and sales strategy, a redesigned website with a new Plant Pals landing page, and a print catalog. 

- With the publicity around the launch, Office Green projects that their customer base will grow by at least 15%.

- Website traffic has dipped slightly over the past three years, from 15K to 13K visits each month. The Marketing Manager wants unique page visits to increase by at least 2K each month by the end of the year, which is in line with the results of prior marketing campaigns.

- The project is scheduled to launch by the end of the third quarter. The project team will continue to collect data on the project’s progress through the rest of the year and assess how well it has met its goals at the end of the fourth quarter. (It is currently the start of Q1.)

**Step 2: Revise the goals to be SMART**

The template contains the two additional project goals for Plant Pals, neither of which meets all the SMART criteria:

1. “Office Green will boost brand awareness”

2. “Office Green will raise their customer retention rate”

Turn these two goals into SMART goals using the information from the scenario above. Write the revised goals next to **SMART Goal One** and **SMART Goal Two**. Your goals should be complete, but brief—one or two sentences is enough.

For example, here is a goal that’s missing some of the SMART criteria:

*“Office Green will soon create an app to help customers care for their plants.”*

That’s not a bad start, but it isn’t specific, measurable, or time-bound. Here’s the same goal, rewritten as a SMART goal:

*“Office Green will create an app that offers tips and reminders to help customers care for their plants. The app will be completed within 18 months and be compatible with 100% of the types of plants Office Green sells.”*

**Step 3: Explain what makes each goal SMART**

Now that you’ve rewritten the goals, explain what makes them SMART by answering the following questions:

1. What makes the goal **specific**? Does it provide enough detail to avoid ambiguity?

2. What makes the goal **measurable**? Does it include metrics to gauge success?

3. What makes the goal **attainable**? Is it realistic given available time and resources?

4. What makes the goal **relevant**? Does it support project or business objectives?

5. What makes the goal **time-bound**? Does it include a timeline or deadline?

Be specific in your answers. For instance, the plant care app SMART goal is:

- **Specific:** The team knows what they’re building: an app that helps users care for their plants and reminds them to do so. 

- **Measurable:** The app will be complete when it includes 100% of the plant types Office Green sells.

- **Attainable:** The company has the knowledge, time, resources to build the app. 

- **Relevant:** Office Green’s business model relies on customers caring for their plants successfully. 

- **Time-bound:** The goal includes an 18-month timeframe.

If you find that either goal does not meet all the SMART criteria, try revising it and answering the questions again.

### Activity Exemplar: Define and determine SMART project goals

**SMART goal one**

The original goal indicates that Office Green will boost its overall brand awareness through Plant Pals, but it doesn’t indicate how they will do it, whether it's possible, why it’s important, or when they will get it done. The SMART goal addresses all these questions, which increases Office Green’s chances of reaching their aim:

“Office Green will boost brand awareness with a new marketing and sales strategy and website update that will increase page views by 2K per month by the end of the year.”

- **Specific:** Office Green will update their website and launch a new marketing and sales strategy to boost awareness of their brand.

- **Measurable:** The goal includes a metric of 2K new page views per month.

- **Attainable:** They have a year to reach this goal and the target of 2K new page views per month is in line with prior marketing campaigns.

- **Relevant:** Greater brand awareness can mean new customers, which supports the overall project goal of a 5% revenue increase.

- **Time-bound:** The deadline is at the end of the year.

**SMART goal two**

The original goal indicates that Office Green will raise their customer retention rate, but it doesn’t indicate how they will do it, whether it's possible, why it’s important, or when they will get it done. The SMART goal addresses all these questions, which increases Office Green’s chances of reaching their aim:

“Office Green will raise their overall customer retention rate by 10% by the end of the year by implementing a new Operations & Training plan for the Plant Pals service.”

- **Specific:** Office Green will implement an Operations & Training plan that will improve on existing customer service standards and boost efficiency. 

- **Measurable:** The goal includes a metric of a 10% increase in retention. 

- **Attainable:** They have a year to reach this goal and many former and existing customers are interested in the new service. It has the potential to help them keep customers who may be thinking about leaving for a landscaper with more services.

- **Relevant:** Increasing customer retention can lead to more sales, which supports the overall project goal of a 5% revenue increase.

- **Time-bound:** The deadline is at the end of the year.

### Introduction to OKRS video notes

objectives and Key results, or OKRS.

Like the SMART method, OKRS help establish and clarify goals or objectives for an organization, department, project or person.

 OKRS take SMART goals a step further by combining a goal and more detailed metrics to determine a measurable outcome.

 **The O stands for objective**, and defines what needs to be achieved. It describes the desired result or outcome, such as an increase in customer retention, or an improvement on the employee onboarding process.

**KR stands for key results.** These are the measurable outcomes that define when the objective has been met. For example, if your objective is to improve customer retention, then the key result might be to have 90 percent customer satisfaction rating by the end of the first quarter.

use OKRS to set stretch goals as a way to challenge ourselves to do something we haven't accomplished before.

In order to focus their efforts to reach this objective, Office Green might develop key results that include 
95 percent of phone, chat, and email customer support tickets are resolved during the first contact.
Top three most requested new offerings for distributed office environments are in pilot by the end of the second quarter
sales and support channels are available 24/7 by the end of the year. 

Some of these company-level key results could become the basis for projects.

### Reading: Creating OKRs for your project

**In this lesson, you are learning to define and create measurable project goals and deliverables. This reading will focus on creating effective objectives and key results (OKRs) and how to implement them into your project.**


Company-wide OKRs are used to set an ultimate goal for an entire organization, while team, department, and project-level OKRs describe the focused results each group will need to achieve in order to support the organization.

##### OKRs and project management

As a project manager, OKRs can help you expand upon project goals and further clarify the deliverables you’ll need from the project to accomplish those goals. Project-level OKRs help establish the appropriate scope for your team so that you can say “no” to requests that may get in the way of them meeting their objectives. You can also create and use project-level OKRs to help motivate your team since OKRs are intended to challenge you to push past what’s easily achievable. 

#### Creating OKRs for your project

##### Set your objectives

Project objectives should be aspirational, aligned with organizational goals, action-oriented, concrete, and significant. Consider the vision you and your stakeholders have for your project and determine what you want the project team to accomplish in 3–6 months.

Examples:

- Build the most secure data security software 

- Continuously improve web analytics and conversions

- Provide a top-performing service

- Make a universally-available app

- Increase market reach

- Achieve top sales among competitors in the region

Strong **objectives** meet the following criteria. They are:

- Aspirational

- Aligned with organizational goals

- Action-oriented

- Concrete

- Significant

To help shape each objective, ask yourself and your team:

- Does the objective help in achieving the project’s overall goals?

- Does the objective align with company and departmental OKRs?

- Is the objective inspiring and motivational?

- Will achieving the objective make a significant impact?

##### Develop key results

Next, add 2–3 key results for each objective. Key results should be time-bound. They can be used to indicate the amount of progress to achieve within a shorter period or to define whether you’ve met your objective at the end of the project. They should also challenge you and your team to stretch yourselves to achieve more.

###### Examples:

- X% new signups within first quarter post launch

- Increase advertiser spend by X%

- New feature adoption is at least X% 

- Maximum 2 critical bugs are reported by customers per Sprint

- Maintain newsletter unsubscribe rate at X%

Strong **key results** meet the following criteria:

- Results-oriented—not a task

- Measurable and verifiable

- Specific and time-bound

- Aggressive yet realistic

To help shape your key results, ask yourself and your team the following:

- What does success mean?

- What metrics would prove that we’ve successfully achieved the objective?

##### OKR development best practices
Here are some best practices to keep in mind when writing OKRs:

- Think of your objectives as being motivational and inspiring and your key results as being tactical and specific. The objective describes what you want to do and the key results describe how you’ll know you did it. 

- As a general rule, try to develop around 2–-3  key results for each objective.

- Be sure to document your OKRs and link to them in your project plan.

##### OKRs versus SMART goals

Earlier in this lesson, you learned how to craft SMART goals for your project. While SMART goals and OKRs have some similarities, there are key differences, as well. The following article describes how SMART goals and OKRs are similar, how they differ, and when you might want to use one or the other:  Understanding the Unique Utility of OKRs vs. SMART Goals

### Determining a project's scope video notes


Simply put, your project scope includes the boundaries of a project. 

You also need a firm understanding of the project's complexity. Is it straightforward with an easily manageable list of tasks? Or will it require extensive research, multiple rounds of approvals, and a large-scale production process that will take years to complete? 

Scope also includes the project timeline, budget, and resources.

***Now, how do you actually figure out the scope of your project? It's simple:*** 

**A:** talk to your sponsors and stakeholders, understand what their goals are, and find out what is, and this is really important, what is not included in the project. 

Here are a few more helpful questions to add to the list. 
 - Where did the project come from? 
 - Why is it needed? What is the project expected to achieve? 
 - What does the project sponsor have in mind? Who approves the final results?

As for timing, defining project **scope should happen during the initial planning stage.** You want to start figuring out the scope early on so that everyone can agree to the same set of expectations. It will help mitigate the risks of big changes down the line. Although you can always adjust the scope as planning continues, if you need to. Once you understand your project scope, you want to document all the details so that anyone can refer back to it throughout the life cycle of the project.  

---

### Monitoring and maintaining a project's scope video notes

**In-scope** - Tasks that are included in the project and contribute to the project's overall goal are considered to be in-scope. 

Tasks that aren't included are called **out-of-scope**. 

It's your job as a project manager to set and maintain firm boundaries for your project so that your team can stay on track.

Changes, growth, and uncontrolled factors that affect a project scope at any point after the project begins are referred to as **"scope creep."** Scope creep is a common problem, and it's not always easy to control. It's one that we struggle with on every single project.

To help you combat scope creep, it's good to know that there are two major sources from which it comes: external and internal. External sources of scope creep are easier to recognize.

While you can't control everything that happens, there are some useful tips to keep in mind. 

- First, make sure the stakeholders have visibility into the project. You want them to know the details of what's going to be produced, what resources are required, how much it will cost, and how much time it'll take. 

- Also, get clarity on the requirements and ask for constructive criticism of the initial product proposal. It's important to get this information before any contracts are signed. Be sure to set ground rules and expectations for stakeholder involvement once the project gets started. 

- Come to an agreement on each of your roles and responsibilities during execution and status reviews. Once you're clear on the project scope, come up with a plan for how to deal with out-of-scope requests. Agree on who can make formal change requests and how those requests will be evaluated, accepted, and performed. 

- And finally, be sure to get these agreements in writing. This way, you'll always have documentation to point if you, a stakeholder, or the customer have a disagreement down the line. One of the leading causes of external scope creep is not being clear on the requirements before defining the scope and getting formal approval to move forward with the project.

### Strategies for controlling scope creep

Scope management best practices
The scope of a project can get out of control quickly—so quickly that you may not even notice it. Scope creep is when a project’s work starts to grow beyond what was originally agreed upon during the initiation phase. Scope creep can put stress on you, your team, and your organization, and it can put your project at risk. The effects of scope creep can hinder every aspect of the project, from the schedule to the budget to the resources, and ultimately, its overall success. 

Here are some best practices for scope management and controlling scope creep: 

**Define your project’s requirements.** Communicate with your stakeholders or customers to find out exactly what they want from the project and document those requirements during the initiation phase. 

**Set a clear project schedule.** Time and task management are essential for sticking to your project’s scope. Your schedule should outline all of your project’s requirements and the tasks that are necessary to achieve them.

**Determine what is out of scope.** Make sure your stakeholders, customers, and project team understand when proposed changes are out of scope. Come to a clear agreement about the potential impacts to the project and document your agreement. 

**Provide alternatives.** Suggest alternative solutions to your customer or stakeholder. You can also help them consider how their proposed changes might create additional risks. Perform a cost-benefit analysis, if necessary.

**Set up a change control process.** During the course of your project, some changes are inevitable. Determine the process for how each change will be defined, reviewed, and approved (or rejected) before you add it to your project plan. Make sure your project team is aware of this process.

**Learn how to say no.** Sometimes you will have to say no to proposed changes. Saying no to a key stakeholder or customer can be uncomfortable, but it can be necessary to protect your project’s scope and its overall quality. If you are asked to take on additional tasks, explain how they will interfere with the budget, timeline, and/or resources defined in your initial project requirements. 

**Collect costs for out-of-scope work.** If out-of-scope work is required, be sure to document all costs incurred. That includes costs for work indirectly impacted by the increased scope. Be sure to indicate what the charges are for. 

---

### Managing changes to a project's scope video notes

In order to decide if a scope change is acceptable and what impact it will have, project managers usually refer to the triple constraint model. **The triple constraint model** is the combination of the three most significant restrictions of any project: scope, time, and cost. 

---

### Launching and landing a project video notes 


**Launch** - Delivering the final result of your project to the client or user is what's called a project launch. You finish building or creating a project, the tasks are completed, and the deliverables are done. You've hit your goal.

**Landing** is when you actually measure the success of your project using the success criteria established at the outset of the project. final outcome to the test.

---
### Reading: Don't forget to land: Measuring project success

##### Launching vs. landing a project
In project management, a project “launching” means you have delivered the final results of the project to the client or user. You can’t solely base project success on when the client accepts the project, though. Your work on a project won’t be complete until you “land” it by thoroughly measuring the results. This is when the success criteria and the metrics you defined initially when setting SMART goals will come in handy.  

Teams should be clear on what they are trying to accomplish, beyond just launching something to users. Will your project increase retention? Will your project speed up a product feature? Depending on the product and situation, the answers will differ, but it is important that your team aligns and works toward the same measurable goal. 

##### Launch first, land later
Let’s consider an example: imagine you are a project manager for an eco-friendly organization. Your organization asks you to create a training program for middle school students in your county to teach them about the impacts of recycling. The county's goal is to increase recycling by 20% over the next five years. You gather your team and start developing the learning content to build out this training program. It takes you and your team one year to complete the research, development, and production of this training. When you hand over the training to the school district, you are launching the project. In order to know your project actually landed at the intended goal, you need to check back in periodically over the next five years to see if the training program is on target to produce a 20% increase in recycling in the county.  

##### Launch and forget
A common mistake of many project teams is to “launch and forget” the results. This happens when a project manager delivers the project to the client and the client accepts the project delivery, but the project manager doesn’t assess if the project deliverables satisfy the customer or user. In the example above, if you didn’t check back periodically over five years to assess the results, you would have only launched—but not landed—the project. Launching and landings work in tandem to ensure true success. 

A project landing shouldn’t create more hurdles. If done correctly, a landing creates greater alignment within the teams on the end results you all desire, and it gives everybody on the team better visibility on how to achieve success.

### Defining success criteria video notes


The **success criteria** will tell you whether or not the project as a whole was successful. They are the specific details of your goals and deliverables that tell you whether you've accomplished what you set out to do. They are the standards by which the project will be judged once it's been delivered to stakeholders and customers. 

**Adoption** refers to how the customer uses and adopts a product or service without any issues. Engagement refers to how often or meaningful customer interaction and participation is over time.

**There are many different ways to measure success**. The key is to pick the methods that work best for your success criteria. It's a good idea that, along with each success criteria on your list, to also include the methods for how success will be measured, how often it's measured, and who's responsible for measuring it. Share your success criteria document with your stakeholders and ask if they agree with how the project's success will be determined. It's also a good idea to have the appropriate stakeholders sign off on the success criteria. 

---
##### Product quality 

The product, or final result, of a project has its own set of attributes that define success. The product attributes that are necessary for the product’s success include completeness in features, quality of features, unit cost, usability, etc. The extent that a product is complete will contribute to the product’s success. This can apply to any project in which you deliver a product or tangible outcome at the end. To keep us on track for success, we can create a list of product requirements to ensure that you do not miss anything. For example, if the project produces word processing software, you need basic features like text entry, formatting, saving, and printing. Since you require each feature to have a functional word processor by today’s standards, you include these features on your checklist. 

To measure the success of a product, consider including these metrics on your checklist: 

- Track if you implemented the product’s priority requirements

- Track and assess the product’s number of technical issues or defects

- Measure the percentage of features you delivered or released at the end of the project

#### What is important to the customers or stakeholders 

We have to pay attention to product metrics, but we also have to be mindful of stakeholder and customer additional expectations for features and objectives. In the word processor example, a stakeholder may want to add an additional functionality to easily create tables in a document with text. Additionally, a strategic goal of the organization could be to create word processor software with more collaborative ability than the word processors currently on the market. Each component is necessary in order to meet customer and stakeholder expectations. Think about what needs the project satisfies for your stakeholders or customers. These strategic goals tie back to the business case and the reason you initiated the project in the first place. Often, you can measure the fulfillment of strategic goals via user or customer metrics. Metrics to consider include:

- Evaluating user engagement with the product 

- Measuring stakeholder and customer satisfaction via surveys

- Tracking user adoption of the product by using sales data

#### Document, align, and communicate success

Understanding where we are and where we are going helps the project team determine if they are on track. As you learned in the video on this topic, you need to get clarity from stakeholders on the project requirements and expectations. There are many people involved with any project, and success will look different for each of them. You want to ask questions, such as: Who ultimately says whether or not the project is successful? What criteria will be measured to determine success? What is the success of this project based on? It is best practice to get the key stakeholders or the steering committee to review and approve your success criteria. This becomes a mutual agreement on how all parties define the success of the project.
